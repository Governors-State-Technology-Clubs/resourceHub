# Resource Hub

Welcome to the Computer Science Society Resource Repository! This repository is dedicated to our collaborative learning journey as we tackle coding exercises, debug challenges, and possibly LeetCode problems together. Here, you'll find a collection of resources and solutions designed to support our learning and growth.


## REMEMBER: As a separate note while working through class work or using external sources, focus on understanding the fundamentals. Fundamentals are the backbone of everything that has ever been made in human history.

# Getting Started

## Getting Started with Our GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Install Git on Your Machine

To start using Git with the GitHub platform, you need to have Git installed on your machine. Follow the instructions below for your operating system:

- **Windows:**
  
  1. Download Git for Windows from the official site: [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
  
  2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
  
  3. Confirm the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing into command prompt:
     
     ```
     git --version
     ```

- **macOS:**
  
  1. Open the Terminal.
  
  2. Install Git using Homebrew (if you don't have Homebrew installed, follow the instructions at [brew.sh](https://brew.sh)):
     
     ```
     brew install git
     ```
  
  3. Confirm the installation by typing in the Terminal:
     
     ```
     git --version
     ```

- **Linux:**
  
  1. Open your Terminal.
  
  2. Install Git using the package manager for your distribution, if you are using Linux I assume you know what package manager you're using. For example, on Ubuntu:
     
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install git
     ```
  
  3. Confirm the installation by typing in the Terminal:
     
     ```
     git --version
     ```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Once Git is installed, clone the repository to your machine:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, Git Bash, or Terminal).
2. Run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Cedric-Lard/studygroup.git
```

### Step 3: Navigate to Relevant Folders

Explore the repository’s folders to find:

- **CodingExercises:** Solutions to class exercises.
- **DebuggingChallenges:** Solutions and discussions on debugging.
- **LeetCodeProblems:** Solutions to LeetCode challenges.
- **Resources:** Useful links to tutorials, documentation, and tools.

### Step 4: Contribute and Collaborate

- ### NOTE: These commands are ran in a terminal like command prompt, BASH, or something similar.

- **Upload Your Solutions:** If you have solutions to share, upload your files to the respective folders.

- **Discuss Issues:** Use GitHub Issues to ask questions or discuss problems encountered. You can also post in the discord.

- **Review and Comment:** Review others’ solutions and provide constructive feedback.

### Step 5: Add, Commit, Push, and Pull

- ## Git Add
  
  To stage changes for a commit in Git, you use `git add -A` command. This will add all the files you modified to Git WARNING: ONLY CHANGE THINGS IN YOUR SPECIFIC FOLDER! If you write a file in someone else's folder PUT YOUR NAME ON IT. If your modifying someone else's file ASK FIRST! Or make your own copy somewhere else on your computer. DO NOT COMMIT AND PUSH CHANGES TO SOMEONE ELSE'S FILE TO THIS REPOSITORY.
  
  ```
  git add -A
  ```

- ## Git Commit
  
  Next commit the changes in Git using the `git commit -m "<Your commit message>" command
  Replace "<Your commit message>" with a brief description of what files you have added.
  
  ```
  git commit -m "Added files to debugging_exercises"
  ```

- ## Git Push
  
  Finally, type the command: 
  
  ```
  git push origin
  ```

- ## Git Pull
  
  If you want an update to date version of the repository run: 
  
  ```
  git pull origin
  ```
  
  And then watch your folders update with everything everyone pushed to github.
  This will add everything to this repo for everyone to see.

### Step 6: Stay Engaged

- **Use Discord:** Join our Discord server for real-time discussions and updates.

### Step 7: Learn and Grow

Take advantage of the curated resources in the **Resources** folder for additional learning.

## Repository Structure **Not Included

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### Coding_Exercises

Contains additional coding exercises. I am hoping to hear your questions and post exercises that helps you guys get better.

- **Completed**: Post your solutions and let's talk about it. It is important to realize that everyone thinks a bit differently and there is technically no "right" answer to coding patterns, conventions, or algorithm usage. Some things work better than others. If you develope a solution that works on your own please share it. It can help you grow to discuss what you did and how you thought of the problem and give us more perspectives.
